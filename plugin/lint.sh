# trmnlp lint, minus one warning that is wrong, and failing on everything else.
#
# THE ONE WARNING. `trmnlp lint` checks each custom field's `field_type`
# against a list vendored inside the gem, and that list predates `lat_lon`,
# the hosted service's Location picker: search a city, pick a match, or type
# coordinates. The field is real and live, this plugin's Location setting has
# used it since it stopped being a plain string, and the hosted service
# accepts it on every push. 0.12.0 is the newest release, so there is no
# upgrade that knows about it, and `FormField::DATA_PATH` is hardcoded to the
# gem's own file, so there is no project-local schema to point it at either.
#
# The alternative was editing the installed gem by hand. That works on one
# machine, is invisible to everybody else, and disappears on the next
# `gem install`, which is how a green lint here turns into a red one
# somewhere else. So the exception lives in the repository instead, where it
# can be read, and it is narrow: this drops that exact line and nothing else,
# and only while settings.yml really does ask for `lat_lon`.
#
# Usage: plugin/lint.sh
